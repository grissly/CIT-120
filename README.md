# CIT-120
This Repository is to hold any projects, labs, or other assignments I complete while in my first semester at Bunker Hill Community College in the Fall of 2015. The class I am taking is an introduction to computer science and is called CIT 120. The class is taught using C++ programming language and with the textbook Starting Out With C++ - (8th ED) - Tony Gaddis.

I wrote all these programs using Visual Studio 2013 Express.

You will find sample exe files provided by the instructor (H. Delta) in the folder with each individual lab.
