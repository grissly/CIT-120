Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to hunt the Wumpus.
The Wumpus lives in a cave system with 20 rooms. Each room has three 
tunnels connecting to other rooms. 

HAZARDS:
Bottomless Pits - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them.
    If you enter, you fall into the pit (and lose!)

Giant Bats - Two other rooms have giant bats. 
    If you enter, the bat grabs you and deposits you in another room 
    at random. (Which might be troublesome.)

WUMPUS:
The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (he has sucker feet and is too 
big for a bat to lift). Usually he is asleep. Two things wake him up: 
entering his room and shooting an arrow.

If you wake the Wumpus, he will eat you (and you lose!)

YOU:
Each turn you will have the option to move or shoot a crooked arrow
    MOVING: you may take any tunnel connecting to your current room
        (be warned, not every room is safe)
    ARROWS: You have ONE arrow. You lose if you shoot and miss the WUMPUS
        (DON'T MISS). Your arrow can be shot into any adjacent room. 
        If the arrow hits the Wumpus, you win.
        If you miss, you will wake the Wumpus and he will eat you!

    WARNINGS:
        When you are in a room adjacent to the Wumpus or a hazard, 
        the computer says:
            Wumpus - 'You smell the unmistakable stench of the Wumpus'
            Bat    - 'You hear the flapping of large wings'
            Pit    - 'You feel an ominous breeze'
